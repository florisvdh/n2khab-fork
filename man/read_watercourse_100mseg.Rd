\title{Return the processed data source \code{watercourse_100mseg}}
\usage{
read_watercourse_100mseg(
  file = file.path(fileman_up("n2khab_data"),
    "20_processed/watercourse_100mseg/watercourse_100mseg.gpkg"),
  element = NULL,
  version = "watercourse_100mseg_20200807v1"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The absolute or relative file path of the data source.
The default follows the data management advice in the
vignette on data storage (run \code{vignette("v020_datastorage")}).
It uses the first \code{n2khab_data} folder that is found when
sequentially climbing up 0 to 10 levels in the file system hierarchy,
starting from the working directory.}

\item{element}{Optional string.
The string must be one of two possible values: \code{"lines"} or
\code{"points"}.
If set, either the \code{lines} or the \code{points} object will be
returned, respectively.}

\item{version}{Version ID of the data source.
Defaults to the latest available version defined by the package.}
}
\value{
By default, a list of two \code{sf} objects (see 'Description').
The \code{lines} and the \code{points} objects have the same number of
rows.
They share the same attributes:
\describe{
\item{\code{rank}}{A unique, incremental number for each segment/endpoint.
It just reflects the downstream-to-upstream order of segments within
each original line.}
\item{\code{vhag_code}}{The VHAG code from the raw \code{watercourses} data
source.
It distinguishes the different watercourses, so it is common to all
segments/points that belong to the same watercourse.}
}
Optionally, only one of these \code{sf} objects is returned.
}
\description{
Returns the data source \code{watercourse_100mseg}
as a list of two \code{sf} objects:
\itemize{
\item \code{lines}
(\code{LINESTRING} geometry): represents
line segments of length 100 m derived from the raw \code{watercourses}
data source;
\item \code{points} (\code{POINT} geometry):
represents the \emph{downstream}
endpoints of all segments ('downstream' as defined in \code{watercourses}).
}
Optionally, only one of these objects is returned.
The coordinate reference system is 'Belge 72 / Belgian Lambert 72'
(EPSG-code \href{https://epsg.io/31370}{31370}).
}
\details{
The data source \code{watercourse_100mseg} represents all officially known
watercourses
of the Flemish Region as line segments of 100 m (or < 100 m, for the most
upstream segment of a watercourse).
The data source can be used as a base layer of statistical
\strong{population units} (line segments) and corresponding anchor points,
in the design of monitoring and research of watercourses.

The data source is a GeoPackage, available at
\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4452577}{Zenodo}, and contains two
spatial layers:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{watercourse_100mseg_lines}: the line segments;}
  \item{\code{watercourse_100mseg_points}: the corresponding downstream
  endpoints.}
  }
Both layers have the same number of rows and share the same attributes.

The data source was derived from the raw
\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4420904}{\code{watercourses}} data
source as follows:
\enumerate{
\item each line ('watercourse') of \code{watercourses} is split into
segments of 100 m, where
the remaining segment of < 100 m (per original line) is situated most
upstream.
For this step, the direction of the lines has been reverted (in
\code{watercourses} the direction is from upstream to downstream).
A unique rank number is assigned to each segment, as well as the
VHAG code from the corresponding line in \code{watercourses}.
\item the downstream endpoint of each segment is located, and assigned the
same attributes (\code{rank} and \code{vhag_code}).
}

The R and GRASS code for creating the \code{watercourse_100mseg} data source
can be found in the
\href{https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-preprocessing}{n2khab-preprocessing}
repository.
