\title{Documentation of included data source 'types'}
\format{
A vc-formatted data source. As such, it corresponds to
a data frame with several variables:
\describe{
  \item{type}{Code of the type, as a factor.
  This is the ID for use in diverse workflows and datasets.
  Names in multiple languages are to be found in \code{\link{namelist}}.
  Only \emph{currently active} codes are kept in this list, in order to avoid
  confusion (this especially relates to habitat subtypes and RIBs).
  Contains no duplicates!}
  \item{typelevel}{A factor that labels the type as
   either \code{"main_type"} or \code{"subtype"}.}
  \item{main_type}{The main type that corresponds with \code{type},
  as a factor.
  Each type is either a subtype of a main type, or is a main type itself.
  This is indicated by \code{typelevel}.}
  \item{typeclass}{A code explained by \code{\link{namelist}},
  corresponding to the typeclass.
  Is a factor.}
  \item{hydr_class}{A code explained by \code{\link{namelist}},
  corresponding to the hydrological class.
  Is a factor.}
  \item{groundw_dep}{A code explained by \code{\link{namelist}},
  corresponding to the groundwater dependency category.
  Is a factor.}
  \item{flood_dep}{A code explained by \code{\link{namelist}},
  corresponding to the flood dependency category.
  Is a factor.
  Note that flood dependency is only defined for (semi-)terrestrial types,
  hence for aquatic types (hydrological class \code{HC3})
  it is \code{NA}.}
  \item{tag_1}{Optional tag, e.g. a categorization ID explained
  by \code{\link{namelist}}.
  Currently used to indicate subcategories within a few typeclasses,
  or to differentiate between lotic and lentic aquatic types.}
  \item{tag_2}{Optional tag, e.g. a categorization ID explained
  by \code{\link{namelist}}.}
  \item{tag_3}{Optional tag, e.g. a categorization ID explained
  by \code{\link{namelist}}.} }

\source{
Most information comes from
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dK0S1Tt3RlVEh4WrNF5N_-hn0OXiTUVOvsL2JRhSl78}{this googlesheet}.
Currently, the googlesheet and the data source are both kept up-to-date.
However only the 'types' data source is under version control.

The source for the hydrological class attribute is a vc-formatted file
stored in the package source code.
It is read by the 'generate_textdata' bookdown project which generates the
'types' data source.
The referred vc-formatted file was derived from a yet unpublished database
on the interrelations
between types, hydrological classes, environmental compartments and their
characteristics, and environmental pressures.

The source for the groundwater and flood dependency attributes is
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bhXgamK28K--MSWF7goKNOWtWPEI149_QCpU-3V_k_E}{this googlesheet}.
Currently, the googlesheet and the data source are both kept up-to-date.
However only the 'types' data source is under version control.

\description{
'types' is a data source in the
\href{https://ropensci.github.io/git2rdata}{vc-format} which provides
a checklist of types, represented by their \strong{current} codes, together
with several attributes.
A 'type' refers to either a (main) habitat type, a
habitat subtype or a regionally important biotope (RIB).
The codes of types, typeclasses and further attributes and tags are
explained in the
data source \code{\link{namelist}} (which can accommodate multiple
languages).
