\title{Return the \code{soilmap} or \code{soilmap_simple} data source as an
\code{sf} multipolygon layer}
\usage{
read_soilmap(
  file = file.path(fileman_up("n2khab_data"),
    "20_processed/soilmap_simple/soilmap_simple.gpkg"),
  file_raw = file.path(fileman_up("n2khab_data"), "10_raw/soilmap"),
  use_processed = TRUE,
  version_processed = "soilmap_simple_v2",
  standardize_coastalplain = FALSE,
  simplify = FALSE,
  explan = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The absolute or relative file path of the \emph{processed} data
source \code{soilmap_simple}.
Used only if \code{use_processed = TRUE} (= default).
The default value follows the data management advice in the
vignette on data storage (run \code{vignette("v020_datastorage")}).
It uses the first \code{n2khab_data} folder that is found when
sequentially climbing up 0 to 10 levels in the file system hierarchy,
starting from the working directory.}

\item{file_raw}{Same as \code{file}, to define the filepath of the \emph{raw}
datasource \code{soilmap}.
Used only if \code{use_processed = FALSE}.}

\item{use_processed}{Logical.
If \code{TRUE} (the default), load and return the processed data source
\code{soilmap_simple}, instead of the raw data source \code{soilmap}.
The central layer of
\code{soilmap_simple} can be manually generated by reading the raw \code{soilmap} data
source with \code{standardize_coastalplain=TRUE}, \code{simplify=TRUE} and
\code{explan=FALSE}, but this takes some time.}

\item{version_processed}{Version ID of the \code{soilmap_simple} data source.
Only used with \code{use_processed = TRUE} (the default).
Defaults to the latest available version defined by the package.}

\item{standardize_coastalplain}{Logical.
Only applied with \code{use_processed = FALSE}.
If \code{TRUE}, fill the values of the morphogenetic substrate,
texture and drainage variables (\code{bsm_mo_substr}, \code{bsm_mo_tex} and
\code{bsm_mo_drain} + their \verb{_explan} counterparts) where possible,
\emph{for features with a geomorphological soil type code}.
This largely applies to features in the 'coastal plain' area.
\itemize{
\item To derive morphogenetic texture and drainage levels from the geomorphological
soil types, a conversion table by Bruno De Vos &
Carole Ampe is applied (for earlier work on this, see Ampe 2013).
\item Substrate classes are copied over from \code{bsm_ge_substr} into \code{bsm_mo_substr}
(\code{bsm_ge_substr} already follows the categories of \code{bsm_mo_substr}).
\item A logical variable is added to the output to mark conversions
(see section \emph{Value}).
}

These steps coincide with the approach that was taken to construct
\code{bsm_mo_soilunitype} in the raw data source.}

\item{simplify}{Logical.
Only applied with \code{use_processed = FALSE}.
If \code{TRUE}, only a limited number of variables that are most
useful for analytical work are returned.}

\item{explan}{Logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}.
Should the \verb{_explan} variables accompanying \code{bsm_mo_xxx} variables be
returned in the \emph{simplified} result?
If \code{use_processed = FALSE}: only has effect if \code{simplify=TRUE}.
(With \code{simplify=FALSE}, the \verb{_explan} variables are always returned.)
If \code{use_processed = TRUE}: is applied in returning \code{soilmap_simple}.}
}
\value{
A Simple feature collection of geometry type \code{MULTIPOLYGON},
representing either the processed data source \code{soilmap_simple} (default) or
the raw data source \code{soilmap}.

Besides the standardization for the coastal plain areas, \code{soilmap_simple}
contains
only a subset of the \code{soilmap} variables (marked with an asterisk below).

The \code{soilmap} attribute variables all start with prefix \code{bsm_} (referring
to the 'Belgian soil map'), in order to distinguish from similar attributes
derived from other maps or field observations.

Most attributes represent categories and are returned as
factors.
When a variable is a one-to-one translation of another (e.g. code vs.
explanation), the order of factor levels is aligned.

Three types of dataframe variables are returned when reading \code{soilmap}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{variables with \code{mo_} in their name}: their categories follow the
Belgian Morphogenetic System.
\itemize{
\item With \code{standardize_coastalplain = FALSE}, these are only available \emph{outside
the coastal plain areas} except for \code{bsm_mo_soilunitype} (which is
standardized already in the raw data source).
}
\item \strong{variables with \code{ge_} in their name}: their categories follow the
Belgian Geomorphological System.
(Note however, that \code{bsm_ge_substr} does follow the Belgian Morphogenetic
System as well.)
\itemize{
\item Values are typically available \emph{within the coastal plain areas},
but some geomorphological soil types (starting with letter \code{O})
have a wider distribution across Flanders.
\item They are \emph{not} included in \code{soilmap_simple}.
\item A special variable is \code{bsm_ge_typology}, which is \code{TRUE} if
\code{bsm_soiltype} follows the geomorphological typology,
and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\item \strong{variables without \code{mo_} or \code{ge_} in their name} are:
\itemize{
\item either \emph{system-agnostic} metadata (first two + last four variables:
\code{bsm_poly_id}, \code{bsm_map_id}, \code{bsm_map_url}, \code{bsm_book_url},
\code{bsm_detailmap_url}, \code{bsm_profloc_url}),
\item or \emph{mixed} (representing \code{mo_} categories within and \code{ge_} categories
outside coastal plains): the other ones, like \code{bsm_region}, \code{bsm_legend},
\code{bsm_soiltype} and \code{bsm_soilseries}.
\item A special variable is \code{bsm_converted}, returned only if
\code{standardize_coastalplain = TRUE}.
}
}

Many variables have a 'counterpart variable' with suffix \verb{_explan}:
they provide a more elaborate textual explanation.
They are not listed below.

Short explanation of attributes is given below.
More elaborate explanations can be found in the references and in metadata
\href{https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/5c129f2d-4498-4bc3-8860-01cb2d513f8f}{at DOV}.
\enumerate{
\item Meaning of the main non-metadata variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{bsm_region} (*): name of the region
\item \code{bsm_ge_region}: code of the region within the coastal plain area
\item \code{bsm_legend}: generalised (simplified) legend key (37 levels)
\item \code{bsm_legend_title} and \code{bsm_legend_explan}:
the legend keys and text of Van Ranst & Sys (2000) (833 and 622 levels,
respectively)
\item \code{bsm_soiltype}: the soil type of the Belgian soil map (mixed nature:
morphogenetic & geomorphological codes).
\code{bsm_soiltype_id} represents a numeric code for each level.
\item \code{bsm_ge_typology}: Logical.
Does the soiltype code follow the geomorphological typology?
\item \code{bsm_soiltype_region}: \code{bsm_soiltype}, followed by a code representing
\code{bsm_region}
\item \code{bsm_soilseries}: either the morphogenetic soil series (outside the
coastal plain areas),
which is the three core characters of \code{bsm_soiltype},
or just \code{bsm_soiltype} if the latter has a geomorphological code.
\item \code{bsm_converted} (*): Logical.
Were morphogenetic texture and drainage variables (\code{bsm_mo_tex} and
\code{bsm_mo_drain}) derived from a conversion table?
This is equivalent with the question: does \code{bsm_mo_soilunitype} differ
from \code{bsm_soiltype}?
Value \code{TRUE} is largely confined to the 'coastal plain' areas.
Only returned if \code{standardize_coastalplain = TRUE}.
(Note: the variable is not included in version \code{soilmap_simple_v1}.)
\item \code{bsm_mo_soilunitype} (*): as \code{bsm_soiltype}, but applying morphogenetic
codes within the coastal plain areas in most cases
(see the \code{standardize_coastalplain}
argument for more information about this conversion)
\item \code{bsm_mo_substr} (*), \code{bsm_ge_substr}: code of the soil substrate
\item \code{bsm_mo_tex} (*): code of the soil texture category
\item \code{bsm_mo_drain} (*): code of the soil drainage category
\item \code{bsm_mo_prof} (*): code of the soil profile category
\item \code{bsm_mo_parentmat} (*): code of a variant regarding the parent material
\item \code{bsm_mo_profvar} (*): code of a variant regarding the soil profile
\item \code{bsm_mo_phase}: code of the soil phase (i.e. additional soil
properties).
They are explained in the book that accompanies the specific analog map
identified by \code{bsm_map_id}.
\item \code{bsm_ge_series}: the geomorphological soil series
\item \code{bsm_ge_subseries}: the geomorphological soil subseries
}
\item Meaning of the metadata variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{bsm_poly_id} (*): unique polygon ID (numeric)
\item \code{bsm_map_id}: code of the analog map covering this area
\item \code{bsm_map_url}: hyperlink to the scanned analog map scale 1:20000 (pdf),
identified by \code{bsm_map_id}
\item \code{bsm_bookurl}: hyperlink to the scanned book (pdf), accompanying the
analog map identified by \code{bsm_map_id}
\item \code{bsm_detailmap_url}: hyperlink to the scanned maps at scale 1:5000
(zip-file with jpg files) belonging to the map identified by
\code{bsm_map_id}
\item \code{bsm_profloc_url}: hyperlink to the scanned maps with the profile
locations
(zip-file with jpg files) belonging to the map identified by
\code{bsm_map_id}
}
}

\description{
Returns either the raw data source \code{soilmap}
or (by default) the
processed data source \code{soilmap_simple}
as a standardized \code{sf} multipolygon layer (tidyverse-styled,
internationalized) in the Belgian Lambert 72 CRS (EPSG-code
\href{https://epsg.io/31370}{31370}).
Given the size of these data sources (especially the raw one), this function
takes a bit longer than usual to run.
}
\details{
The raw data source is published
\href{https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/5c129f2d-4498-4bc3-8860-01cb2d513f8f}{at DOV}
(Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen) and
is discussed by Van Ranst & Sys (2000) and Dudal et al. (2005).
A 'pure' (single) dataformat of the raw data source (no metadatafiles etc.)
has also been stored (with versioning) at
Zenodo (\doi{10.5281/zenodo.3387007}) - which we refer to as the
\code{soilmap} data source - in order
to support the \code{read_soilmap()} function and to sustain long-term workflow
reproducibility.

The processed data source \code{soilmap_simple} is a GeoPackage, available at
\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3732903}{Zenodo}.

Note that factors are generated with implicit \code{NA} values (i.e. there is
no factor level to represent the missing values).
If you want this category to appear in certain results, you can convert
such variables with
\code{\link[forcats:fct_explicit_na]{forcats::fct_explicit_na()}}.

In case the raw data source \code{soilmap} is used
(\code{use_processed = FALSE}), it is possible to
manually perform the standardization for coastal plain features and/or the
simplification,
both of which were applied in the \code{soilmap_simple} data source.
See \emph{Arguments} for more information.

See R-code in the \href{https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-preprocessing}{
n2khab-preprocessing} repository for the creation of the
\code{soilmap_simple} data source from
the \code{soilmap} data source.
}
\examples{

# This example supposes that your working directory or a directory up to 10
# levels above has the 'n2khab_data' folder AND that the latest version of
# the 'soilmap_simple'
# data source is present in the default subdirectory.
# In all other cases, this example won't work but at least you can
# consider what to do.
